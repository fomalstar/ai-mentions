# 🚀 AI Keyword Tool & Mentions - Complete Development Plan

## Project Overview

**Traditional SEO tools are becoming blind.** They can see website rankings but have no visibility into whether a brand is being recommended or ignored in the AI-powered answers that are rapidly replacing standard search results. This creates a critical new gap in marketing intelligence.

### The Goal
To create the essential, go-to SaaS platform for marketers, SEOs, and brand managers who want to measure, understand, and improve their visibility for the future of search.

### The Problem It Solves
As users increasingly turn to AI for answers and recommendations, a massive blind spot has emerged. Businesses have no way of knowing the search volume, trends, or user intent behind the millions of queries happening in AI chats. Traditional SEO tools only measure Google search, leaving marketers unable to compete on this new and rapidly growing frontier.

### The Solution: An AI Conversation Intelligence Platform
This SaaS platform will be the first of its kind to put AI search data front and center. It will provide a suite of tools built upon a unique dataset of AI query intelligence.

## Core Features

### AI Keyword Research Tool (The Main Feature)
This is the heart of the platform. Users can research any keyword and receive a rich dashboard of AI-specific metrics, including:

- **AI Query Volume**: The core, proprietary metric showing how often a keyword is used in AI chats
- **AI Query Trends**: Data showing whether a topic's popularity is growing or declining over time
- **AI-Generated Questions**: The most common actual questions people are asking AI about the keyword
- **Mention Opportunity Score**: Strategic scoring for each question to identify brand mention opportunities
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Automated insights on which questions to target for maximum brand visibility

### Topic Tracking & Brand Monitoring
After identifying valuable AI keywords, users can track their brand's performance:

- **Topic Tracking**: Add topics to a tracking dashboard with brand names
- **Daily Refresh**: Topics refresh every day to capture new AI responses
- **Brand Detection**: Monitor when brands appear in AI answers
- **Success Metrics**: Track brand visibility success over time

### AI Query Insights (The "How" and "Why")
This is your unique selling point. The tool shows data about how real users are interacting with AI models regarding topics:

- **Top AI-Generated Questions**: List of most common actual questions people ask AI
- **Mention Opportunity Scoring**: Strategic scoring (1-10) for each question
- **Query Volume Analysis**: Relative metrics for question popularity
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Automated insights on which questions to target
